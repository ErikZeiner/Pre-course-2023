# Pre-course (2023)

In October 2023, I was part of a team of students which organised a 5-day orientation event for incoming students at the Institute of Linguistics, University of TÃ¼bingen. My responsibilities were updating the event website, speaking to the students about our programme and university, giving a brief introduction to the concepts behind programming, and explaining and demonstrating the installation of tools and applications needed for our studies.
